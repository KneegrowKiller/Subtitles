Dialogue: 0,0:24:34.68,0:24:37.02,CN,,0,0,0,,當大家看到EHOME的時候
Dialogue: 0,0:24:37.47,0:24:40.35,CN,,0,0,0,,他們就自然而然的認為  王者要入場了
Dialogue: 0,0:24:45.51,0:24:50.10,CN,,0,0,0,,其實這次國際邀請賽的時間安排跟我的考試時間是完全衝突的
Dialogue: 0,0:24:50.31,0:24:55.65,CN,,0,0,0,,所以我這次放棄了考試  是為整個隊伍  也是為我自己
Dialogue: 0,0:24:56.22,0:24:57.15,CN,,0,0,0,,而且我發現

Dialogue: 0,0:24:59.80,0:25:01.71,CN,,0,0,0,,判斷是否值得做出這個犧牲…
Dialogue: 0,0:25:01.97,0:25:03.05,CN,,0,0,0,,完全取決於自己
Dialogue: 0,0:25:10.23,0:25:14.24,CN,,0,0,0,,當學校有考試的時候  校方是不會允許他離開學校的
Dialogue: 0,0:25:14.94,0:25:17.97,CN,,0,0,0,,所以我讓他好自為之
Dialogue: 0,0:25:19.66,0:25:22.92,CN,,0,0,0,,職業電競選手這條路風險非常高
Dialogue: 0,0:25:23.74,0:25:26.02,CN,,0,0,0,,因為考試和比賽的時間總是衝突
Dialogue: 0,0:25:26.02,0:25:29.45,CN,,0,0,0,,所以我總是無故缺席考試
Dialogue: 0,0:25:29.46,0:25:32.92,CN,,0,0,0,,校方才不會承認參加Dota比賽是正當理由
Dialogue: 0,0:25:33.66,0:25:35.14,CN,,0,0,0,,這已經算是違反校規了
Dialogue: 0,0:25:36.05,0:25:41.38,CN,,0,0,0,,學校在阻止他參加比賽這件事情上態度十分堅決
Dialogue: 0,0:25:42.30,0:25:46.87,CN,,0,0,0,,因此我覺得他給這個家庭帶來了很大的壓力
Dialogue: 0,0:25:49.05,0:25:51.37,CN,,0,0,0,,讓他媽媽非常頭疼
Dialogue: 0,0:25:57.06,0:26:00.50,CN,,0,0,0,,但是我覺得  現在要把他拉出來很難了
Dialogue: 0,0:26:00.61,0:26:02.43,CN,,0,0,0,,他在這件事情上很堅決
Dialogue: 0,0:26:02.43,0:26:04.98,CN,,0,0,0,,所以當他告訴我他八月要去參賽的時候
Dialogue: 0,0:26:05.31,0:26:08.67,CN,,0,0,0,,我就問他  那你學校的考試怎麼辦？
Dialogue: 0,0:26:08.67,0:26:10.59,CN,,0,0,0,,你又打算怎麼辦
Dialogue: 0,0:26:12.14,0:26:14.46,CN,,0,0,0,,我覺得我母親在她所說的遊戲拖累我這件事情上
Dialogue: 0,0:26:14.46,0:26:17.28,CN,,0,0,0,,已經說得夠多了
Dialogue: 0,0:26:17.29,0:26:19.61,CN,,0,0,0,,所以那次談話我完全敞開了心  我…
Dialogue: 0,0:26:20.29,0:26:22.87,CN,,0,0,0,,向她傾訴了我對遊戲的激情
Dialogue: 0,0:26:23.28,0:26:25.70,CN,,0,0,0,,以及我堅信我的隊伍有機會奪冠
Dialogue: 0,0:26:25.71,0:26:26.69,CN,,0,0,0,,成為世界第一
Dialogue: 0,0:26:26.97,0:26:29.74,CN,,0,0,0,,所以我們不奪冠的話絕不會停下
Dialogue: 0,0:26:30.46,0:26:32.29,CN,,0,0,0,,這就是我試著讓我母親理解我的方式
Dialogue: 0,0:26:32.74,0:26:33.98,CN,,0,0,0,,為了到這裡來我放棄了很多
Dialogue: 0,0:26:33.98,0:26:36.35,CN,,0,0,0,,我絕對相信我的隊伍能夠奪冠
Dialogue: 0,0:26:37.40,0:26:39.18,CN,,0,0,0,,現在正在挑選上場的英雄陣容
Dialogue: 0,0:26:39.19,0:26:41.19,CN,,0,0,0,,EHOME將選擇他們使用的英雄
Dialogue: 0,0:26:41.19,0:26:42.87,CN,,0,0,0,,Scythe也會開始選自己用的
Dialogue: 0,0:26:43.10,0:26:44.34,CN,,0,0,0,,現在看看兩支隊伍
Dialogue: 0,0:26:44.35,0:26:46.18,CN,,0,0,0,,EHOME看起來很放鬆
Dialogue: 0,0:26:46.18,0:26:47.75,CN,,0,0,0,,而Scythe  我們都知道他們渴望勝利
Dialogue: 0,0:26:47.75,0:26:50.23,CN,,0,0,0,,他們都聚在hyhy周圍討論該選哪個英雄
Dialogue: 0,0:26:50.45,0:26:52.35,CN,,0,0,0,,如果你的陣容就很差的話  你會輸掉比賽的
Dialogue: 0,0:26:52.80,0:26:54.27,CN,,0,0,0,,這是我對Dota的看法
Dialogue: 0,0:26:54.77,0:26:57.14,CN,,0,0,0,,所以陣容的選擇真的很重要
Dialogue: 0,0:26:57.52,0:27:01.37,CN,,0,0,0,,陣容的選擇就是雙方隊長在比賽開始前選擇他們本場比賽想使用的英雄
Dialogue: 0,0:27:01.51,0:27:04.48,CN,,0,0,0,,可以選擇使用一些英雄  也可以禁止一些英雄被選
Dialogue: 0,0:27:04.82,0:27:07.79,CN,,0,0,0,,你可以從一百多個英雄中選擇五個
Dialogue: 0,0:27:07.79,0:27:09.80,CN,,0,0,0,,同時禁用掉四個
Dialogue: 0,0:27:09.89,0:27:12.80,CN,,0,0,0,,所以如果你覺得哪四個英雄你的對手可能會選擇
Dialogue: 0,0:27:12.81,0:27:13.83,CN,,0,0,0,,你可以把他們禁掉
Dialogue: 0,0:27:14.36,0:27:16.18,CN,,0,0,0,,在任何一場比賽開始前
Dialogue: 0,0:27:16.46,0:27:18.01,CN,,0,0,0,,我們都會針對我們的對手
Dialogue: 0,0:27:18.10,0:27:19.91,CN,,0,0,0,,來選擇哪些英雄要禁用  哪些要上場
Dialogue: 0,0:27:20.34,0:27:23.34,CN,,0,0,0,,通常情況下我們的戰術大多是即興想出來的
Dialogue: 0,0:27:23.44,0:27:25.00,CN,,0,0,0,,然後用以對抗對手的戰術
Dialogue: 0,0:27:25.01,0:27:27.34,CN,,0,0,0,,陣容的選擇非常需要時間進行思考
Dialogue: 0,0:27:27.34,0:27:30.06,CN,,0,0,0,,選出來的陣容大多就會確定比賽的基調
Dialogue: 0,0:27:31.73,0:27:34.03,CN,,0,0,0,,EHOME是一支經驗十分豐富的隊伍
Dialogue: 0,0:27:34.22,0:27:36.18,CN,,0,0,0,,他們已經想好了這場比賽的策略了
Dialogue: 0,0:27:36.18,0:27:38.09,CN,,0,0,0,,對他們來說唯一能夠影響比賽結果的
Dialogue: 0,0:27:38.10,0:27:40.02,CN,,0,0,0,,就是他們自身的執行力
Dialogue: 0,0:27:41.50,0:27:42.34,CN,,0,0,0,,面對那樣特殊的陣容搭配
Dialogue: 0,0:27:42.34,0:27:46.18,CN,,0,0,0,,我們當時覺得應該選一個打亂他們陣腳的英雄
Dialogue: 0,0:27:47.17,0:27:49.51,CN,,0,0,0,,Scythe這邊的最後一個選擇是小小
Dialogue: 0,0:27:49.91,0:27:51.65,CN,,0,0,0,,Scythe的這個選擇挺有趣的
Dialogue: 0,0:27:51.66,0:27:54.15,CN,,0,0,0,,這樣他們的英雄分路就完全變了
Dialogue: 0,0:27:54.48,0:27:57.11,CN,,0,0,0,,選擇小小是一個出乎對方意料的戰術
Dialogue: 0,0:27:57.44,0:28:00.76,CN,,0,0,0,,如果對手搞不清楚這個英雄在我們這套陣容裡的定位
Dialogue: 0,0:28:00.92,0:28:03.38,CN,,0,0,0,,那你就成功的打亂了對手的陣腳了
Dialogue: 0,0:28:03.89,0:28:05.83,CN,,0,0,0,,hyhy要往回走了  不對
Dialogue: 0,0:28:05.83,0:28:08.16,CN,,0,0,0,,他要轉身扔起莉娜
Dialogue: 0,0:28:08.80,0:28:09.98,CN,,0,0,0,,我現在想說明的是
Dialogue: 0,0:28:09.98,0:28:12.36,CN,,0,0,0,,EHOME並不是一幫菜鳥
Dialogue: 0,0:28:12.37,0:28:15.74,CN,,0,0,0,,只是Scythe發揮得太出色了
Dialogue: 0,0:28:16.23,0:28:18.18,CN,,0,0,0,,當有這麼多觀眾看著你
